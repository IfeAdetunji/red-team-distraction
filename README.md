# red-team-disctraction
By Ife Adetunji

This tool is to not be used for illegal or malicious purposes and is for educational purposes.

This powershell script is a tool to obfuscate and distract blue team powershell systems. This tool takes input from the shell and 
outputs random gibberish that isn't decipherable by the end user. 

This script also hides the history of the script being made and changes the date it was modified so it doesn't seem suspicious.
